  <img src="../images/stroganoff.jpg">

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Easy Beef Stroganoff is pure comfort food (and really easy to make).</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Beef – Use steak in this recipe for great flavor and tender results. Try sirloin steak, ribeye, or beef tenderloin. Regardless of which cut of beef you choose, be sure it doesn’t overcook. </li>
    <li>Onions & Mushrooms – Onions and mushrooms not only add great flavor to this dish, but they also help stretch the stroganoff a bit further! Use either white or cremini mushrooms.</li>
    <li>Stroganoff Sauce – Sauce for beef stroganoff is so easy, it practically cooks itself. Broth and seasonings are thickened with a bit of flour and it’s finished off with sour cream (or swap in Greek yogurt if you’d like). </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Sear the Beef: Cut the beef into strips and sear in a hot pan per the recipe below.</li>
    <li>Cook the Veggies: Cook onions & mushrooms in butter until softened. </li>
    <li>Make the Sauce: Stir in the flour and then add the remaining sauce ingredients and simmer. </li>
    <li>Stir in Sour Cream: Stir the beef back into the pan until heated through. Stir in sour cream & serve. Garnish with fresh parsley if you’d like.</li>
  </ol>
